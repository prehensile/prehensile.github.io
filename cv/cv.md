## Creative Technology, Research & Development

#### Tinkerer, prototyper, committed generalist, Glue person, consensus-builder, facilitator. Occasional futurist. Data science lab assistant. AI whisperer.

In over two decades working in creative technology, I've developed a good nose for emerging technologies and their potential for professionals and the public. 

I have led successful teams both technical and cross-disciplinary — the latter is where my heart is. I've done a lot of design, concepting, and pitching and I am trained in video & audio production.

I've created websites, games, 3D environments, mobile and desktop apps, interactive stories, art installations, and many prototypes in both software and hardware. In one memorable case, I built a giant talking throne for a Christmas event in a Royal Palace. I've experimented with digital storytelling, natural language processing, spatial audio, machine learning and made art from edge-cases of speech recognition and computer vision.

I put these skills to use as an independent creative R&D consultant, helping clients understand emerging technology through research, strategy and hands-on prototyping.

## Professional skills

Trained Agile Project Manager, Product Owner, and Mental Health First Aider. Skilled facilitator and workshop leader. Empathetic leader, communicator and consensus-builder. Adept at working with creative, management, and engineering colleagues on their own terms, and fostering communication between disciplines. [Glue person](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/glue-people-one-most-desired-job-market-enza-artino/). Engaging public speaker and precise and thoughtful writer.

## Technical skills

Expert in Python and skilled in JavaScript, both client and server-side. Proficient in HTML & CSS, with some C++, Java, Processing, and C#. I can usually pick up whatever stack is most useful for the job at hand, and I have extensive experience in the use and development of LLM-based tools to extend my skills.

Former iOS and Flash developer. Comfortable using and developing APIs and fluent in JSON, REST, OAuth, XML, etc. I know my way around a command line, and frequently tinker with virtual machines in various parts of The Cloud. Familiar with AWS, Azure, Heroku, etc. Regularly work with Raspberry Pi, comfortable with Arduino and intermediate electronics. I'm competent with a soldering iron.

## Career history

A timeline of my career and selected projects is available at
[prehensile.co.uk/timeline](https://prehensile.co.uk/timeline/)

### The Freelance Years, Round Two
#### 2025 — present, Creative Technology R&D Consultant

I help my clients to understand emerging creative technologies through a mix of strategy, facilitation, and hands-on prototyping projects.

### The BBC Research & Development Years
#### 2016 — 2024, Senior Producer & Creative Technologist, Lead Foresight Researcher

As a producer at BBC R&D, I designed and led exploratory projects around emerging media technologies, most notably [voice assistants](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/talking-with-machines) and [spatial audio](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2021-01-audio-augmented-reality-spatial-voice). As a technologist, I built prototypes on [my own and other projects](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/people/henry-cooke?Type=Projects&Decade=All) to get a practitioner's feel for technologies and their possibilities.

As a researcher, I [published](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Henry-Cooke/46422799) guidelines and papers communicating the findings of our projects. I spent my last few years there [building](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2022-07-introducing-r-and-d-futures) futures and foresight practices around the organisation and publishing very well-received [foresight reports](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/articles/2025-06-social-media-change-issues-problems-report).

### The Freelance Years
#### 2008 — 2016, Creative Technologist

In 2008, my instincts were leading me to the creative possibilities opening up on the iPhone. During this time, I worked on projects in Flash and iOS, including the [first app to be nominated for a TV BAFTA](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/mobile-phones/8475033/Malcolm-Tucker-iPhone-app-nominated-for-Bafta.html) and Björk's _Biophilia_ '[app album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biophilia_(album)#App)'.

This time was also marked by artistic collaborations. Highlights include work with [Dora Garcia](https://twentythreemillionstories.org/) and [Crystal Bennes](https://www.crystalbennes.com/portfolio/when-computers-were-women/), and experimental theatre projects leading to [The Body](https://nigelandlouise.com/The-Body) at the Barbican in 2015 — "[a seat-shaking, soul-searching techno-futurist experience](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/nov/22/the-body-review-barbican)" which won that year's Oxford Samuel Beckett Theatre Trust Award.

Sometimes these threads came together. In 2013, I collaborated on [a magical talking throne](http://elkworks.co.uk/throne) for a Christmas event at Kensington Palace, and in 2019 I [investigated audience-tracking technologies](https://motherultimate.com/projects/theatre) for legendary immersive theatre company [Punchdrunk](https://www.punchdrunk.com).

### The Design Agency Years
#### 2004 — 2008, Flash Developer

I started my London agency career in 2004, making Flash microsites and games. This is where I learned both the craft of creative software development, and agency-standard visual design. I joined [Preloaded](https://www.preloaded.com) in 2006, where I made [Launchball](https://preloaded.com/work/launchball/) which racked up over 10 million plays and won a slew of awards, including Best in Show at SXSWi 2008.

## Education
### BA (Hons) Media Production, University of Lincoln
#### 2001 — 2004

I was already a good coder by the time I left school, and didn't think I'd get much out of a Computer Science degree. I was enjoying making short films and videos, and made a bet that media production would make a useful combination with the programming I already knew.

The critical theory and production skills I learned at Lincoln have been consistently useful and evolving bits of my toolkit ever since.
